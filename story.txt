two baskets were fighting about who can catch more fruits.
they decided that that they will have a competition about.
basket1 decided that it will cheat and keep some fruits in from before.
though basket2 decided that it will play fair.
so the competition began
but the basket1 got a better idea. he put all the fruits he was carying on basket2 without making him realise.
